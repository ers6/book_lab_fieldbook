Writing 23 years ago about British scientific book publishing, Adrian Johns declared “a printed book can be seen as a nexus conjoining a wide range of worlds of work” (Johns). Back in 1998, Johns probably did not anticipate the degree to which digital economies of scale would grant researchers access to digital versions of historical and contemporary texts making the book and its history more accessible than ever before. Nor did he anticipate that these digital economies of scale would add multiple more layers of remediation and with it networks of labor, only to be made invisible behind plasma screens and unreadable code. Indeed, as Bethany Novwiske insists “all information is embodied information, and…our information practices have an impact on real, vulnerable human bodies and natural and created environments” (Nowviskie).

Throughout the semester we have explored different methods for writing embodied accounts of media history/the networked book: data archaeology, bibliography, infrastructural analysis, digital humanities, network analysis, etc. Matthew Kirschenbaum brings many of these together in his article, “Bibliologistics.” Accordng to Kirschenbaum, “book history alone…is not enough” to study the book-production supply chains of the present (Kirschenbaum). Instead he coins a new method called bibliologistics which is “a combination of network analysis and site-specific research… that understands that books — individually and in aggregate — leave traces in ecological, economic, and many other registers” (Kirschenbaum). I personally love Kirschenbaum’s commitment to site-specificity, but I wonder if bibliologistics is, as he claims, really beyond the history of the book. Perhaps what he’s really talking about is a kind of geographic bibliography.

On a pretty unrelated line of thinking: I was fascinated by the idea that DNA could be used as a digital storage solution. It made me want to write a 21st century _Frankenstein_ where Dr. Frankenstein is trying to use DNA as a digital storage solution, but then it turns out it’s alive! The creature would become a meme spouting embodiment of Web 2.0. In all seriousness, what would it mean to use DNA as a digital storage solution for the embodied history of the book?
