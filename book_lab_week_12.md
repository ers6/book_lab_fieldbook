I majored in English in undergrad in a department with a number of digital humanists but even more new formalists. Thus, the close vs. distance reading debate seemed to echo through the halls. Staunch new formalists/new critics argue that distance reading is incapable of accounting for the literariness of texts in question through reducing them to data. Early distance readers, on the other hand, like Jockers and Morretti, argued that distance reading was the only truly neutral method to analyze text without projecting scholars biases on them. Katherine Bode suggests that “contrary to prevailing opinion, distant reading and close reading are not opposites. These approaches are united by common neglect of textual scholarship: the bibliographical and editorial approaches that literary scholars have long depended on to negotiate the documentary record” (Bode 19). Bode is especially interested in how Jockers and Morretti’s approach to literary history was similar to that of new critics who also neglected editorial and bibliographic theories. Rachel Scarborough King suggests that genre may be a mediating scale between the breadth of distance and the narrowness of close reading. Genre, as King understands it, “represent[s] acts of association—made by writers, readers, critics, scholars, and/or computers—that generate usable configurations of texts, while forms identify literary patterns within a text” (King 261). Importantly, genre is something situated in a particular time and place with both specific formal and extratextual features. King suggests genre, thus, can balance new formalist and distance reading agendas. I think genre is one, but not the only scale scholars can use to mediate close and distance reading. Dan Sinykin and Richard Jean So both practice distance and close reading to study the history of publishing in the US. They are able to ground their distance reading in the specificity of one or a few publishing houses’ documentary records. Thus, the scope of the publisher allows Sinykin and So to speak about the patterns their distance readings reveal concretely.

Unfortunately the close vs. distance reading debate in literary studies has produced a dichotomous and reductive attitude towards algorithms/computation analysis in the humanities. Ben Schmidt explains that digital humanists, especially people in literary studies, tend to either decry computational analysis as reductive or celebrate it without subjecting it to critique. Schmidt argues that neither of these approaches are sufficient. Instead, digital humanists “should be able to understand the goals and agendas of the transformations and systems that algorithms serve so that we can be creative users of new ideas, rather than users of tools the purposes of which we decline to know” (Schmidt). In her “Machine Reading the Primeros Libros Library,” Hannah Alpert-Abrams analyzes and historicizes the transformations OCR performs on the primeros libros corpus. She argues that OCR’s transformations have historical parallels in interpretive reproduction systems, and through understanding these tools, “we can bring to the surface the traces these tools leave on digital documents. This may allow us to recognize how digital projects implicitly reinforce historical hierarchies of power and knowledge even as our scholarship works to critique or counteract those systems" (Alpert-Abrams). Alpert’s study of transformation bridges both the analog and computational eras to show how computation reproduces and reinforces analog regimes of power.

The history of computing, and really anything for that matter, is always already mediated by power. Stephen Wolfram’s history of Ada Lovelace and Charles Babbage reveals how heteropatriarchy has occluded Ada Lovelace’s contribution to the history of computation. Wolfram is a mathematician, and so his work is more documentary than analytical. That being said, he shows how histories of computational abstraction play out on the ground. The negotiation of computational method and documentary evidence is a ripe area for humanistic intervention.
