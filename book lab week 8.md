# Book Lab Week 8: Image

The intermixing of text and image we associate with most art books is older than the purely textual codex of today. Before there was black text on white paper, there were illuminated manuscripts rich in color, scrolls of script and illustration, and cave paintings in red and black. With the industrialization of book production in the west, text and image seemed to drift apart into separate spheres. Unlike monks who wrote both script and designed illustrations, printing separated text-setting devices from those of image. It’s no surprise, then, that we think of text and image as separate entities today, but I think that’s a pretty recent phenomenon. In the late 18th and early 19th century, William Blake invented a means of mechanized printing that alluded to the manuscript tradition my creating text-images. It is for this reason, many consider Blake to be the first book artist.

Yet, as I was reading the Borsuk chapter I found myself asking, “what’s the difference between an art book and a book of any other kind?” Borsuk defines art books as those that “[engage] with the book as an idea [bringing] its material form back into the conversation" (Borsuk 113). This definition troubles mee because it seems to hinge on authorial/artist intent. If an artist intended to create a bookwork that engages with the book as an idea, then it’s an art book. However, can a book—independent of its creator—ever be an art book? Put differently, is an art book a bookish object an artist creates? If the artist is dead, then so too is the art book!

Rather than suggesting we need specific methods to study art books, what if we were to study all books as both book as content and idea? Doing so challenges and expands our understand of book independent on authorial intention. I’d argue that’s what we’ve been doing all semester, anyway! The other works this week apply this “bookwork” approach to items typically not understood as artistic or bookish. For example, in her “Book Face,” Jaqueline Goldsby analyzes the migration of the author's face from the inside cover to the back of the book and the rise of Black American literature's popularity in the literary marketplace amid Jim Crow's repressive heights. Through making paratextual image, not text, the subject of her analysis, Goldsby shows that the shifting place of image signals a change in the author function in Black American literature from the 19th to mid 20th century. Likewise, Caroline Wigginton argues that non-alphabetic images of Indigenous nation’s pipes warrant enumerative bibliographic study. According to Wigginton, “approaching Indigenous pipes as books without claiming they are solely books or always the same kind of book honors their sym­bolic status; acknowledges that they too are repositories of narrative and wisdom; empha­sizes that interpreting or reading a particular pipe requires many kinds of expertise and literacy, including linguistic, cultural, material, and familial" (Wigginton). After all, literacy is not purely textual. Like words, images, material, and culture must be read. Untethering reading from alphabetic text allows the idea of book to be expanded without a need to account for authorial intent. Furthermore, Piper, Wellmon, and Cheriet show that current computational methods of studying books privilege alphabetic text, obscuring the “page image.” Studying the page as image accounts for a richer understanding of para text, body text, and how the two constitute each other.
