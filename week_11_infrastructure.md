This week’s readings included seminal book history essays—Robert Darnton’s “What is the History of the Book” and DF McKenzie’s “The Book as an Expressive Form”—Vannevar Bush’s “As We May Think,” canonical to the information sciences, and contemporary essays that apply or challenge these three. All pieces prompt us to question “what is the role of infrastructure in histories of the book?”

Robert Darnton’s 1982 “What is the History of the Book?” introduced book history to history departments in the U.S. Up until his article, historians in the US had largely ignored histories dealing with anything other than political economy, government, and religion. Thus, Darnton’s work is crucial in the field of cultural and social histories. That being said, scholars criticize Darnton’s circuit of communication for its exclusion of non-print, non-codex media as well as its singular focus on public facing, capitalist forms (Coker). His 2007 essay is meant to be a revision of that 1982 article, but, again, he excludes books not created for public consumption and sale. Darnton’s approach to book history, while deeply flawed, is still useful especially when studying infrastructure. The guiding questions he suggests book historians should answer all move beyond question of text towards questions of infrastructure: how do books come into being, how to they reach readers, and what do readers make of them? (Darnton 495). DF McKenzie’s approach can be understood as complimentary to that of Darnton, but more flexible. McKenzie’s sociology of texts allows us to use bibliographic methods to look beyond a book object towards the sociocultural structures that produce them. At the same time, he does not propose particular structures that mediate all books allowing for a more inclusive practice of bibliography and book history than that of Darnton. In its dedication of structures that create meaning over time (not jut synchronically), McKenzie’s work can also be understood as infrastructural. Both McKenzie’s sociology texts and Robert Darnton’s interest in infrastructure seem to inform Ben Lee’s article. A traditional approach to bibliography would not allow Lee to ask why some newspapers end up and the newspaper navigator data set and which do not. It would allow him to describe how the same image looks different in different newspapers, explains the technologies that caused this, but make no argument as to why this was the case.

Much unlike book history, information science tends to approach infrastructure as a neutral phenomenon. I have read “As We May Think” in every iSchool class I’ve taken so far with the exception of my introduction to python course. Every time I bring up that Vannevar Bush coordinated the Manhattan Project, but I have never actually been able to discuss Vannevar’s complicity in US nuclear imperialism in an information science course. Instead, when reading “As We May Think,” we have focused exclusively on the memex’s relationship to “search.” I think that’s telling of how information science regards itself: as a neutral field. That, of course, couldn’t be further from the case. To be fair to Bush, he never indicates the memex is a neutral machine. That’s just how information scientists tend to read it. If anything, it bears more in common to a 19th century personal index than anything else. But setting all that aside, as Buurma reminds us, indices and the contemporary digital “search” functions they enable are never neutral. The decision of what to index always involves enacting a value judgment on what is important in the indexed text. So what if we were to index everything? Could we be neutral then? Grounding contemporary circuited technologies in corporate exploitation of women of color, Nakamura reminds us that no technology is ever neutral. It is always already a product of human laborers who are more often than not women of color, over worked, and underpaid if paid at all.

Infrastructure turns our attention to the human built structures and organizations that build, maintain, and destroy our built environment. It enables an approach to book history and information sciences that foregrounds the human built-ness of the book and information writ large.
