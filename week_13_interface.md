This week’s readings were easily the most bizarre things I’ve read in grad school. As much as I loved these works, I have no idea how to talk about them. So, here goes nothing…

Borsuk’s final chapter of _The Book_ explores the idea of book as interface. Borsuk pushes back against the recent hegemony of book as content to explore the mechanisms that transport content: interface. An interface, according to Borsuk, is “a structuring mechanism, whose paratexts and affordances present us with possibilities that shape the meaning we make as readers (and writers) and returns some agency to us in the face of the closed interface” (Borsuk 258). While we generally we expect interfaces to be invisible and only notice them when they defy expectations, all interfaces are mechanisms that shape the meanings we produce from a book.

Both _AI dungeon_ and Louis Braille’s invention of braille type exemplify how interfaces can restore agency to readers. _AI dungeon_ allows its reader to select a scene and character for a story. It prompts the reader with situations and asks them to respond by saying, doing, or creating a story. The AI responds to the reader’s input. In this way, the AI interface’s mechanism is structured around how a reader makes meaning. Braille as interface provides another, less literal, example. Louis Braille invented braille type in 1821 as an alternative to raised letter systems sighted instructors for the blind had used for reading. Braille, unlike raised alphabetic letters, feels distinct under a finger. Unlike raised alphabetic type, braille is an interface designed by and for blind readers. The interface makes print books accessible to blind readers thereby granting them agency.

_Agrippa_ and _17776_ are, likewise, conscious of interface, but use their interfaces to raise questions about obsolescence. Both works are interested in themes of obsolescence but to totally different ends. _Agrippa’s_ interface is meant to obsolesce. After playing Gibson’s poem once the diskette encrypts itself and makes the poem and book totally unreadable. Ashbaugh planned to render text on _Agrippa’_s pages in disappearing ink so that after reading the book would also destroy itself. I should mention the book is named for the 1920 Kodak Agrippa camera, and Gibson’s encrypting poem is a reflection on family photos taken with an Agrippa. Most of the print book is the genetic code of a fruit fly, a creature that lives only 8-15 days. The point I’m trying to make about obsolescence is that in _Agrippa_ all things are ephemeral. The book can be experienced as a whole only once before destroying itself forever. It is alive and then dead. Here and then gone.

In sharp contrast, Bois’s _17776_ depicts a world 15,000 years in the future where nothing has changed expect football. In 2026, people stopped being born and dying. With the exception of nanoparticles to prevent people from seriously injuring themselves, no new technology has been invented, but none of the 20th and 21st century technologies, infrastructure, etc. have broken either. In my view, the climax of the story occurs when a 500 football smashes into the oldest piece of technology in the world: an 1890 Edison bulb that has been burning for 15,000 years. Ten eulogizes the bulb, saying “it was the oldest functioning electric being in the known universe. It was our dearest ancestor. Year over year, century over century, it continued to astonish us: it was, after all, a light bulb that stayed on for over 15,000 years without burning out or breaking. It was a miracle, and yet, it did not occur to us that it could die” (Bois). This is the only moment in all of _17776_ in which media truly obsolesces, and Bois characterizes it as the only death/loss in the entire novelette. What do we make of this? What do we make of the fact that _17776_, itself, is built on an interface that will certainly obsolesce in time? In what ways does the story’s medium (interface) reinforce/contradict its message? What do we make of the different attitudes towards obsolescence in _17776_ and _Agrippa_? What might this tell us about different attitudes towards digitally interfaced books in 1992 and 2017? Keeping in mind that Bois’s _17776_ was distributed freely online and _Agrippa_ was a limited production art book selling for $2000, what’s the relationship between obsolescing media and capital?
