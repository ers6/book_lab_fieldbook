This week’s texts all discuss texts composed using cut/paste methods and, in doing so, historicize contemporary cut/paste information management and composing strategies.

Too often, we characterize cut/paste, collaborative authorship as unique to Web 2.0. Jim DeVoss and Danielle Nicole, for example, suggest rhetorical velocity, “a conscious rhetorical concern for distance, travel, speed, and time, pertaining specifically to theorizing instances of strategic appropriation by a third party” is something particular to a digital environment (DeVoss and Nicole). The authors use rhetorical velocity as a principle for teaching students how to craft effective rhetoric within a digital environment where their work may circulate across times and spaces far from its original context. However, this type of writing is not, as the authors imply, unique to a digital environment.

In her _Writing with Scissors,_ Garvey describes how people in the 19th century clipped articles from newspapers to create scrapbooks to manage information overload. While scrapbooking was a widespread practice across people of nearly all backgrounds, it has not received much scholarly attention in part because scrapbooks are rarely included in archives. Still, scrapbooks represent personal archives that are rich sources of information about marginalized people whose stories are rarely represented in other records. Cut/paste texts were not just restricted to personal scrapbooks; rather, they compose the majority of 19th century newspapers as the _Viral Texts Project_ documents. The “Love Letter to _Viral Texts”_ shows how references to _Viral Texts_ were incorporated into composition of “original” work as well. Cut/paste composing methods, remixing, and collaborative authorship are integral to 19th century newspaper rhetoric and information management practices. These practices persist well into the 20th century in the form of fanzines. These, like 19th century newspapers, often feature recirculated articles and texts literally cut and pasted into them. Many of the zines featured in QZAP aestheticize cut/paste images to create social commentaries on gender, sexuality, and capitalism (see Pussy Grazer 1992 for an example). Remediation via cut/paste is not unique to Web 2.0 nor are compositional strategies that predict remediation.

Perhaps rhetorical velocity seems “new” because of how book historians have feminized and degraded cut/paste publications. In her 2017 article, Cait Coker historicizes fanzines in a lineage of women-created publications. She suggests if we consider fanfics as literature—trouble the digital/print, literary/pulp divide—we can recognize fanfics as part of a larger pattern of how feminized literature is created, distributed, and consumed first within private circles and later (if ever) the mass market. Many zines, like those discussed in the _Zine Code of Ethics_, were intended for a private audience and include private information about their creators that should not become publicly accessible. Yet, hegemonic conceptions of book history, especially that of Robert Darnton, privilege masculinized public circles of publication. Put differently, our models of book history account for texts created in commercial ventures for wide scale production, distribution, and consumption. Fanzines and other feminized publications fall outside of that purview and are, therefore, ignored.
