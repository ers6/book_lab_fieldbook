**Reflection**
Up until I had to move my type to the galley, I was doing pretty well. All those humid, St. Louis summers I spent in an overly-air conditioned, dimly lit basement proofreading xml documents against 16th century black letter trained me to pay the perfect amount of attention to letters and characters without getting wrapped up in their meaning. Indeed, my excerpt contained no typos on my first try! My hands were small enough to reach into the California case, grasp 14 point Calson italic type, and place it in the composing stick with relative ease. Yet, when the time came to move my type to the galley it became clear I lacked the dexterity to curl my fingers around the metal and exert pressure to it at the same time. Kindly, you offered to move my type to the galley for me. Then, when you handed me the page form containing my typeset poem and those of others, my hand nearly slipped through the furniture, spilling type to the floor. Everyone’s hearts leapt from our chests. The page was heavy for me, and in trying to balance it, I held on to the furniture, nearly dislodging it. While the kind of literacy I practiced as a proofreader made me a speedy and accurate compositor and the size of my fingers lent themselves to the physicality of typesetting, my lack of strength and dexterity made me a disastrous printer.

To complete this lab, I’m taking inspiration from a typo in the prompt: “who are they[texts] form?” This was probably supposed to say “who are texts _for_?”, but my misinterpretation of the typo produced intriguing question: “who _do_ texts form?” Who do these texts of metal—moveable, hot, and cold—form? What kind of body-minds to these machines and the spaces that contain them enable? Disable? How is disability, like “print culture” misunderstood as fixed? To answer these questions I jotted down some characteristics of the different types of printing technologies we’ve explored so far and the spaces that contained them: moveable type, linotype, and digital type:

**Cold Moveable Type: incunable period to late 19th century and what we did in lab!**
 - Heavy- needed to be strong to carry it and even hold the composing
   stick. I felt my wrist getting sore while setting the metal type.
 - Small type- workers needed excellent dexterity to reach into cases   
   and set type in composing sticks
 - Individual letters/characters - You didn’t need to know how to read- 
   just pick characters that matched other characters
 - Literacies fostered- certain kinds of neurodivergent reading would be
   super helpful here! The kind of reading I had to do as an editor   
   wasn’t natural for me; I’ve had to train myself to read this way over
   years. However, my sister notices patterns of characters without   
   attributing meaning to them as a default. This kind of literacy is   
   often disabling because school privileges interpretive literacies.   
   However, in this case her ability to notice minute patterns would   
   make her an excellent compositor. I wonder if compositors over the   
   years have read like her.

**Hot Metal Type – late 19th century to 1970s**
 - Linotype shop was loud - deafness was an advantage in the linotype
   print shop because it was so loud. Communication via sign language
   was necessary.
 - Still needed to be strong to carry page forms
 - ETAOIN SHRDLU keyboard meant that you could theoretically be a
   linotype operator with fewer digits than are helpful to type quickly
   using a qwerty keyboard. In the 2012 _Linotype_ film, an operator
   explains he was the quickest typist at his paper while missing two
   fingers. His boss thought this would make him slow and did not want
   to hire him.
 - Didn’t necessarily need to know how to read although it was helpful
   in recognizing when an editor didn’t catch an error but not
   necessary. Like cold moveable type, linotype operators weren’t
   expected to know how to read. That being said, many operators could
   recognize when an editor missed an error. Reading, while by no means
   necessary, was a valued skill for linotype operators.
 - Needed a lot of nimbleness to move in harmony with the machine and
   recognize when it was going to spit hot metal at you. I would
   definitely be bad at this.

**Cold Digital Type: 1970s-present (how I'm writing this now)**
 - Compositor or typesetter is no longer a job in the digital age as it
   once was. Authors, editors, and graphic designers are all
   “typesetters” of a sort.
 - Less physically demanding – you don’t need to lift anything, be able 
   to walk, etc. to “set” digital type.
 - QWERTY keyboard - It is helpful to have two dexterous hands with   
   fingers you can move a lot. The QWERTY keyboard is designed to almost
   always be used with two hands as the most common letters in the   
   English language (for which the keyboard was designed) are on   
   separate sides of the keyboard.
 - I don’t think deaf people represent a disproportionate number of page
   setters – granted page setter isn’t really a job in and of itself   
   anymore
 - Now you do need to know how to read (interpretive literacies) to   
   operate most computers. It’s difficult to read their error messages  
   and navigate their controls without being able to read.

**Analysis**
Print culture isn’t just a material culture, it’s a corporeal one. By this, I mean that print culture, like all material cultures, is a product of  the body-minds of human beings who manipulate, assemble, and transform materials into cultural goods. As such, the technologies print culture creates and relies on as well as the spaces that house them enable and disable particular body-minds. In my case, the demands of moveable type printing disabled my body (strength and dexterity) while enabling my mind (editorial literacy).

Understanding print culture as a world “founded in metal, wood, ink, paper, engineering, and human labor” foregrounds that print is a man-made technology and the print shop as a constructed space that is inclusive of certain mind-bodies and exclusive of others. The shifts from cold moveable type to hot metal type to cold digital type print cultures highlights corresponding changes in who is disabled and who is enabled in the print shop. Looking back to different eras of print culture, we see that unlike other workplaces and technologies, the conditions of the print shop enabled mind-bodies that would have otherwise been disabled in different built environments around different industries. As such, print culture provides a fascinating case study into how disability isn’t essential; humans construct environments that are disabling.

**I should mention this observation is by no means groundbreaking. Scholars of disability studies and crip theory have been making these arguments now for decades.
